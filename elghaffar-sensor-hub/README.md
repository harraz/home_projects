# ESP8266 MQTT Motion Relay Controller â€” Deer Deterrent System

This project transforms an ESP8266 module (e.g., ESP-01S) into a Wi-Fi-enabled motion controller that:
- Detects motion via a PIR sensor
- Controls a relay either locally or remotely via MQTT
- Publishes motion events and status as JSON messages
- Accepts real-time configuration commands through MQTT
- Seamlessly integrates into a multi-device, multi-zone deterrent network
