# ESP8266 MQTT Motion Relay Controller ‚Äî Deer Deterrent System

This project transforms an ESP8266 module (e.g., ESP-01S) into a Wi-Fi-enabled motion controller that:
- Detects motion via a PIR sensor
- Controls a relay either locally or remotely via MQTT
- Publishes motion events and status as JSON messages
- Accepts real-time configuration commands through MQTT
- Seamlessly integrates into a multi-device, multi-zone deterrent network

## üåø Real-World Use Case: Deer Deterrent System

This system is deployed outdoors to protect gardens and flower beds from deer intrusion. It works as follows:

- **PIR Sensor Nodes** (numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., n) are placed strategically around the perimeter.
- When motion is detected, the sensor sends a **motion message via MQTT** to a central dispatcher.
- The **Dispatcher Hub** processes the signal and triggers the appropriate **Action Device**.
- **Action Devices** (each with a relay and solenoid valve) activate water sprays to scare off deer.

**Components:**
- **Sensor Nodes:** ESP8266 + PIR + MQTT client
- **Action Devices:** ESP8266 + Relay + Solenoid Valve (connected to water hose)
- **Dispatcher Hub:** Raspberry Pi running MQTT broker + Python dispatcher using Paho MQTT

**Flow:**
1. Motion detected ‚Üí MQTT `motion` topic
2. Dispatcher routes the alert to correct action zone
3. `REL_ON` sent to action device via MQTT
4. After delay (~15 sec), `REL_OFF` command stops the spray

This network is reliable, modular, and scalable ‚Äî suitable for outdoor automation and wildlife deterrence.

## üì¶ Features

- Motion-triggered relay control with debounce and timeout
- MQTT messaging using structured topics with dynamic MAC & device names
- Fully supports multiple device groups (e.g., ELGHAFFAR, BASYOUNEE)
- JSON-formatted motion payloads with metadata
- Configurable via MQTT commands (e.g., polling interval, reboot)

## üîå Hardware Setup

| Component   | ESP8266 Pin |
|-------------|-------------|
| PIR Sensor  | D4 (GPIO2)  |
| Relay       | D3 (GPIO0)  |
| VCC/GND     | Common power & ground lines |

> **Power Notes:** Ensure each device has a reliable 3.3V supply (>250mA). Use external regulators for solenoids/relays.

---

## üì° MQTT Setup

Each ESP8266 publishes to MQTT topics structured as:

home/{GHAFEER_NAME}/{MAC}/status  
home/{GHAFEER_NAME}/{MAC}/motion  
home/{GHAFEER_NAME}/{MAC}/cmd

Where:
- `GHAFEER_NAME` = logical group or sensor location (e.g., ELGHAFFAR, HAGRRAS)
- `MAC` = device MAC address in uppercase, no colons

**Example:**

home/BACKYARD/C0A80123/status  
home/BACKYARD/C0A80123/motion  
home/BACKYARD/C0A80123/cmd

---

### Broker Configuration (Python Dispatcher)

The dispatcher is implemented using the **Paho MQTT Python client**, and lives in the [`markaz/`](https://github.com/harraz/home_projects/tree/main/elghaffar-sensor-hub/markaz) directory of this project.

Example dispatcher behavior:
- Subscribes to: `home/+/+/motion`
- Extracts: `GHAFEER_NAME` and `MAC` from the topic
- Determines which action device(s) to activate
- Sends `REL_ON` to `home/{ActionName}/{MAC}/cmd`
- Waits (e.g., 15 seconds), then sends `REL_OFF`

This enables centralized control, zoning logic, and flexible future integrations such as AI filtering or event scheduling.

> ‚öôÔ∏è MQTT broker and dispatcher both run on a local Raspberry Pi, allowing full control of local automation without the cloud.

## üß™ MQTT Command Reference

Commands are published to:  
home/{GHAFEER_NAME}/{MAC}/cmd

| Command                    | Description                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `REL_ON`                  | Turn relay ON                                    |
| `REL_OFF`                 | Turn relay OFF                                   |
| `REL_STATUS`              | Query relay state                                |
| `PIR_INTERVAL:<ms>`       | Set PIR polling interval                         |
| `SKIP_LOCAL_RELAY:true`   | Disable local relay control                      |
| `SKIP_LOCAL_RELAY:false`  | Enable local relay control                       |
| `REBOOT`                  | Reboot the ESP8266 device                        |
| `STATUS`                  | Report MAC, IP, and relay mode                   |

---

## üì§ Motion JSON Format

When motion is detected, a JSON message is published:

```json
{
  "motion": true,
  "mac": "C0A80123",
  "location": "BACKYARD",
  "ip": "192.168.1.99",
  "time": 123456789
}
```

---

## üß† Behavior Flow

1. Device boots and connects to Wi-Fi + MQTT
2. PIR checked every `PIR_INTERVAL` ms
3. If motion is detected:
   - Relay activated (if not skipped)
   - MQTT motion JSON published
   - Status update sent
4. After 2 minutes (or via `REL_OFF`), relay is disabled

---

## üß© Multi-Device, Multi-Zone Support

- Each device operates independently using its own topics
- The dispatcher maps `GHAFEER_NAME + MAC` ‚Üí one or more action zones
- Allows localized responses without overlap
- Fully asynchronous ‚Äî no need for devices to know each other

---

## üì∂ Wi-Fi Setup

Create a `secrets.h` file:

```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID     "your-ssid"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "your-password"
```
